    <p>
        Cha Kreung Satch Moan is a traditional Cambodian chicken stir-fry known for
        its vibrant and complex flavors. The dish begins with a kreung paste made
        from makrut lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal, and ginger, which is cooked
        first to concentrate its flavors and release aromatic oils. Holy basil or
        Thai basil is added to bring freshness and balance to the pungent base.
        The chicken is stir-fried in two batches to ensure proper searing and 
        avoid steaming, preserving its texture. Crisp jalapeños are incorporated
        just before serving, adding a bright, fresh element. This meticulous preparation
        results in a richly flavored, well-balanced dish that exemplifies the depth and vibrancy of Cambodian cuisine.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the Kreung:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a large granite mortar and pestle, combine lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, and makrut lime leaves and grind to a smooth but slightly fibrous paste. These are the toughest, most fibrous ingredients in the paste, so it will take 5 to 10 minutes for the paste to form.</li>
        <li>Once the paste has formed, add shallot and garlic and pound again to smash them into the paste, another 3 to 5 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Add basil to the mortar and pound until it is fully incorporated into the paste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Stir-Fry:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a wok, heat 1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable oil over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add roughly half of the kreung to the wok, stirring and scraping constantly with a wooden spatula to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. At first, the paste will snap and pop as it begins to release moisture. Continue stirring until all visible moisture has cooked off and the paste has thickened and darkened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to high, then add half of the chicken to the wok, along with 1 piece of mudfish (if using) and cook, stirring, until chicken is coated in the kreung and has turned white on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in half of fish sauce, sugar, and bouillon and scrape browned bits from the bottom of the wok (some may still adhere). Stir in half the basil. Once basil has wilted, reduce heat to low and add half of jalapeño slices, cooking until warmed through but still crisp. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Scrape contents of wok into a serving bowl and discard fermented fish. Rinse and dry wok, then repeat with remaining oil, kreung, chicken, and other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Serve stir-fry right away, passing steamed white rice at the table.</li>
    </ol>
